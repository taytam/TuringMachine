#######################

This project simulates the operation of a Turing Machine given an input string file (tm.str) and a definition file (tm.def).

The tm.str string file may contain any number of strings of any desired length.

After launching this application, the user will interact with the Turing Machine application using a defined set of user commands.  For more information on the commands available, enter 'h' on the command line.
